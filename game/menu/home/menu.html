  Congrats! You found Cutie Clicker's menu!
  <br>
  <br>
  Cutie Clicker is unfinished, and I'm trying my best to make it super fun to play! I can't make any promises, but I'm fairly certain that your game data won't need to be wiped in future updates, so play as much as you want!
  <br>
  <br>
  You'll notice that I'm leaving a lot of notes here and there in English. Eventually, I want to avoid using English entirely, and instead have everything explained via pictures and stuff! That way, anyone can at least guess how stuff works, right?
  <br>

  Cherry Cutemas! Keep checking here for a possible cutemas event, if I can implement one in time!

      It looks like you're playing on http!

    If you decide to add Cutie Clicker to your phone's home screen, please make sure you're adding <a href="https://cc.aideen.pw/">https://cc.aideen.pw/</a> for (slightly) faster loading times.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you wannya switch to https, feel free to <a href="https://cc.aideen.pw/">navigate there and update your bookmarks</a>. Note that in most cases, your game data won't carry over, which is why you don't get redirected automatically. If you want auto-redirection, just <a href="$misc">delete your http game data</a>, and you'll get redirected automatically! It's a safety measure I put in to make sure you don't just randomly lose your game unless you delete it yourself.
