  Congrats! You found Cutie Clicker's menu!
  <br>
  <br>
  Cutie Clicker is unfinished, and I'm trying my best to make it super fun to play! I can't make any promises, but I'm fairly certain that your game data won't need to be wiped in future updates, so play as much as you want!
  <br>
  <br>
  You'll notice that I'm leaving a lot of notes here and there in English. Eventually, I want Cutie Clicker to have minimal English, and instead have everything explained via pictures and stuff! That way, anyone can at least guess how stuff works, right?

  Are you having trouble getting enough <span class="cs cs-excitement"></span> to fill your cutie's orb? No worries! Just <a href="$store">buy yourself a new cutie card</a>, <a href="$cuties">switch to it</a>, and +<span class="cs cs-love"></span> it instead! I'll be adding in something that will require you to have lots of cutie cards with lots of <span class="cs cs-love"></span> in the future, so you might wannya start preparing for that!
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>HAVING MORE CUTIE CARDS WILL DRAIN YOUR <span class="cs cs-excitement"></span> FASTER.</strong>

      It looks like you're playing on http!

    If you decide to add Cutie Clicker to your phone's home screen, please make sure you're adding <a href="https://cc.aideen.pw/">https://cc.aideen.pw/</a> for (slightly) faster loading times.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you wannya switch to https, feel free to <a href="https://cc.aideen.pw/">navigate there and update your bookmarks</a>. Note that in most cases, your game data won't carry over, which is why you don't get redirected automatically. If you want auto-redirection, just <a href="$misc">delete your http game data</a>, and you'll get redirected automatically! It's a safety measure I put in to make sure you don't just randomly lose your game unless you delete it yourself.
