  Congrats! You found Cutie Clicker's menu! <a href="$" id="menu-home-clicks-tweet">Tweet your clicks?</a> <a href="$" id="menu-home-clicks-tumblr">or Tumblr?</a> <a href="$" id="menu-home-clicks-copypaste">or copy and paste?</a> You get a different message every time you try!
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm not working on Cutie Clicker anymore, since it's gotten a little too big and ambitious and for me to handle alone. I think I'll be working on smaller projects for now until I find someone to help me work on Cutie Clicker! You can keep track of what I'm doing on Twitter or <a href="https://aideen.pw">aideen.pw</a>.

      It looks like you're playing on http!

    If you decide to add Cutie Clicker to your phone's home screen, please make sure you're adding <a href="https://cc.aideen.pw/">https://cc.aideen.pw/</a> for (slightly) faster loading times.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you wannya switch to https, feel free to <a href="https://cc.aideen.pw/">navigate there and update your bookmarks</a>. Note that in most cases, your game data won't carry over, which is why you don't get redirected automatically. If you want auto-redirection, just <a href="$misc">delete your http game data</a>, and you'll get redirected automatically! It's a safety measure I put in to make sure you don't just randomly lose your game unless you delete it yourself.
